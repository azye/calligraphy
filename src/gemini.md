# Gemini Task Summary (src Directory)

This document summarizes the changes made within the `src` directory.

## Testing

- Created `utils.test.ts` to test the utility functions.
- Created `canvas.test.ts` to test the main canvas logic.
- Implemented mocks for `konva`, `localStorage`, and `document` to isolate components for testing.
- Fixed linting errors in `canvas.test.ts` by removing unused imports and replacing `any` casts with specific types.

## Refactoring

- Exported all functions and state from `canvas.ts` to improve testability.
- Converted `function` keywords to arrow function notation in `main.ts` for consistency and modern TypeScript practices.
- Fixed linting errors in `canvas.ts` by converting a ternary expression to an `if/else` statement.
