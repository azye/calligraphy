# Gemini Task Summary (src Directory)

This document summarizes the changes made within the `src` directory.

## Testing

- Created `utils.test.ts` to test the utility functions.
- Created `canvas.test.ts` to test the main canvas logic.
- Implemented mocks for `konva`, `localStorage`, and `document` to isolate components for testing.
- Fixed linting errors in `canvas.test.ts` by removing unused imports and replacing `any` casts with specific types.

## Refactoring

- Exported all functions and state from `canvas.ts` to improve testability.
- Converted `function` keywords to arrow function notation in `main.ts` for consistency and modern TypeScript practices.
- Fixed linting errors in `canvas.ts` by converting a ternary expression to an `if/else` statement.

## Comprehensive Test Improvements (Latest Session)

### Canvas Tests (`canvas.test.ts`)
- **Enhanced Undo/Redo Testing**: Created 37 comprehensive tests covering all undo/redo scenarios
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Added tests for empty history, corrupted state, rapid operations, and boundary conditions
- **State Isolation**: Fixed global state reset in `beforeEach` to prevent test interference
- **Type Safety**: Removed all `as any` assertions and implemented proper TypeScript typing
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Added 8 tests for Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y, and Mac Cmd variants
- **Performance Testing**: Added tests for large history (1000 operations) and complex patterns
- **Mock Improvements**: Enhanced Konva and DOM event mocking for realistic testing

### Grids Tests (`grids.test.ts`)
- **New Test File**: Created comprehensive test suite for grid rendering functions
- **Individual Function Testing**: Added exports for `renderGridBorder`, `renderBasicGrid`, `renderPlusGrid`, `renderCrossGrid`
- **Mock Setup**: Implemented proper Konva mocking with type-safe assertions
- **Edge Cases**: Added tests for different canvas sizes and grid configurations
- **All 11 tests passing**: Complete coverage of grid rendering functionality

### Type Safety Improvements
- **Eliminated `as any`**: Replaced all type assertions with proper TypeScript typing
- **Mock Event Objects**: Created proper `KonvaEventObject` mocks without DOM dependencies
- **State Management**: Improved state type safety throughout test suite
- **Error Handling**: Added tests that properly detect implementation bugs

### Test Quality Enhancements
- **False Positive Detection**: Fixed tests that were passing incorrectly due to poor mocking
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests now match actual implementation behavior
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Every test verifies complete state changes, not just method calls
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Tests work on both Windows and Mac keyboard layouts
