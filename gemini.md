# Gemini Task Summary (Root Directory)

This document summarizes the project-level changes.

## Dependency Management

- Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions in `package.json`.
- Installed `vitest`, `@vitest/ui`, and `jsdom` as dev dependencies.
- Installed `eslint-config-prettier` and `eslint-plugin-prettier` for ESLint and Prettier integration.

## Build & Test Configuration

- Configured `vitest` in `vite.config.ts` to use the `jsdom` environment for testing.
- Added `test` and `test:ui` scripts to `package.json` for running tests.
- Updated `eslint.config.js` to include `tseslint.configs.stylistic` and integrate Prettier for modern TypeScript linting standards.

## Recent Test Improvements (Latest Session)

- **Comprehensive Test Suite Enhancement**: Significantly improved test coverage and quality across the entire codebase
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Eliminated all `as any` type assertions for better TypeScript type safety
- **Test Isolation**: Fixed state isolation issues to prevent test interference
- **Mock Improvements**: Enhanced mock setup for Konva objects and DOM events
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Added comprehensive edge case testing for undo/redo functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Added tests for large datasets and complex operation patterns
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Added tests for both Windows (Ctrl) and Mac (Cmd) keyboard shortcuts

## Test Fixes

- **Fixed Failing Test**: Resolved a `TypeError` in the canvas setup test by providing a more complete mock for the `Konva.Layer` object, ensuring the `hitCanvas` property was available.
