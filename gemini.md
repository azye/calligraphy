# Gemini Task Summary (Root Directory)

This document summarizes the project-level changes.

## Dependency Management

- Updated all project dependencies to their latest versions in `package.json`.
- Installed `vitest`, `@vitest/ui`, and `jsdom` as dev dependencies.
- Installed `eslint-config-prettier` and `eslint-plugin-prettier` for ESLint and Prettier integration.

## Build & Test Configuration

- Configured `vitest` in `vite.config.ts` to use the `jsdom` environment for testing.
- Added `test` and `test:ui` scripts to `package.json` for running tests.
- Updated `eslint.config.js` to include `tseslint.configs.stylistic` and integrate Prettier for modern TypeScript linting standards.

## Recent Test Improvements (Latest Session)

- **Comprehensive Test Suite Enhancement**: Significantly improved test coverage and quality across the entire codebase
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Eliminated all `as any` type assertions for better TypeScript type safety
- **Test Isolation**: Fixed state isolation issues to prevent test interference
- **Mock Improvements**: Enhanced mock setup for Konva objects and DOM events
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Added comprehensive edge case testing for undo/redo functionality
- **Performance Testing**: Added tests for large datasets and complex operation patterns
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Added tests for both Windows (Ctrl) and Mac (Cmd) keyboard shortcuts

## Test Fixes

- **Fixed Failing Test**: Resolved a `TypeError` in the canvas setup test by providing a more complete mock for the `Konva.Layer` object, ensuring the `hitCanvas` property was available.

## Download Button Feature

- **Added Download Button**: Added a download button to the UI in `index.html`.
- **Implemented Download Functionality**: Implemented the `downloadCanvas` function in `src/canvas.ts` to download the canvas as a PNG file.
- **Added Event Listener**: Added an event listener to the download button in `src/events.ts` to trigger the download functionality.
- **Added Test for Download**: Added a test for the download functionality, ensuring the canvas is downloaded with a timestamped filename.

## Grid System Enhancement

- **Grid Dropdown UI**: Added a dropdown menu to the sandwich menu in `index.html` with 4 grid options (Basic, Plus, Cross, Rice).
- **Grid Selection Events**: Implemented event handlers in `src/events.ts` for grid selection with localStorage persistence.
- **Grid Mode Configuration**: Updated `src/config.ts` to support multiple grid types with proper TypeScript enums.
- **Dynamic Grid Rendering**: Refactored `renderGridLayer` in `src/canvas.ts` to handle all grid types with proper cleanup.
- **Cross Grid Optimization**: Implemented efficient `renderCrossGrid` function that draws X patterns in each cell using minimal lines.
- **Grid Styling**: Updated grid line styling with improved dash patterns and stroke widths for better visibility.
- **FontAwesome Integration**: Added FontAwesome CSS for dropdown icons and improved UI aesthetics.

## User Interactions

- **Grid Switching**: Users can now switch between different grid types via the dropdown menu without losing their drawings.
- **Persistent Settings**: Grid selection is saved to localStorage and restored on page reload.
- **Responsive Dropdown**: Dropdown menu closes when clicking outside and toggles properly on button click.
- **Drawing Preservation**: User drawings are preserved when switching between grid types through proper layer management.
